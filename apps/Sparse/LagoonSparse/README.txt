The S2A test case reads the geometry file S2A.obj. From this obj file, the size of the domain is determined. The size of the domain is then adapted to fit the number of cells per block. This means it is extended in all directions such that a natural number of blocks consisting of the given number of cells per block would fit for the direction. In this way, the number of blocks for the block forest is calculated and distributed to the processes.

With the predefined parameters at the domain, 504 blocks are created and distributed. The test contains a check if too many processes are used. This means if the test case started with 591 processes, there would be one process with no work, which aborts the application.

The number of cells and blocks does not change when the number of processes is increased. Thus increasing the number of processes results in a strong scaling benchmark. If the parameter domainScaling is adapted, it increases the bounding box around the S2A.obj geometry. Thus it increases the number of blocks needed. Another way to increase the work is to adopt the resolution in x, y or z-direction. This is done with the parameter dx. If cells per block would be decreases, it would also increase the number of blocks since the smaller blocks would be created then.

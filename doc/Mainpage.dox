\subsection basics Basics

Welcome to the waLBerla Framework, a widely applicable lattice Boltzmann simulation code
from Erlangen. The following tutorials show you how to get and build waLBerla and describe
all the basic data strcutures and concepts of the framework.

- \ref setup_instructions \n
  This page describes how to obtain a copy of waLBerla and how to setup your environment for development.
- \ref tutorial_basics_01 \n
  The first tutorial explains the basic data structures of waLBerla and how to setup a simple domain.
- \ref tutorial_basics_02 \n
  The second tutorial shows how to write algorithms that operate on block data.
- \ref tutorial_basics_03 \n
  The third tutorial deals with communication, iterating field/grid/lattice data, and geometry setup.

\section further_info Further information

Not all features of the framework are covered in the tutorials.
To get further information have a look at the modules pages.

Also, the test cases provided in the tests directory are a good starting point for your own developments.
Additionally, there is a folder for full-fledged application codes to be found under \ref apps/benchmarks where also codes of walBerla publications are found.
